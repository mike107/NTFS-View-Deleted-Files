Use Overlapped IO or threading to reduce CPU processing latency between reads 
   (in RetrieveMode.Minimal I get 200MB/s read, in RetrieveMode.Full only 150MB/s)
   
Maybe add FileRead capability 
   (need to experiment with reading a lot of small files with classic mode and directly from Ntfs)

Add Events while processing to allow client apps to display cluster map in realtime (like JkDefrag does...)

Try to reduce memory footprint of the Full mode even more...
